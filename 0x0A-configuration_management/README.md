Explain to me Configuration management? Take it as if I am a child asking this question.:

Alright! Imagine you have a big box of LEGO bricks. Each brick is like a piece of a computer program or system.

Now, let's say you build a cool LEGO castle using a specific set of bricks and in a specific order. You want to remember how you built it so that if you ever take it apart or if a piece falls off, you can fix it or rebuild it the same way. You also might want to show your friends how to build the exact same castle.

Configuration management is like keeping track of all those LEGO bricks you used, where you placed them, and how they fit together. It's a way to remember and keep track of how everything is set up in a computer system or program.

In the real world, computer systems and programs can be very complex. So, when something goes wrong, or if you want to make a change, having a record of how everything was set up can be super helpful! Just like having instructions for your LEGO castle helps you and others know how to build it or fix it.
