1. **Round Robin**:
    - This is one of the simplest methods for distributing client requests.
    - Each server is selected in turns, according to their list order.
    - It works best when all servers have similar processing capabilities.

2. **Least Connections**:
    - The server with the fewest active connections receives the next connection.
    - It's more suitable for situations where servers have varying capabilities.

3. **Least Response Time**:
    - Directs traffic to the server with the least average response time for a new connection.

4. **IP Hash**:
    - Determines the server to send a request based on the IP address of the client.
    - By using a hash function, it determines a fixed server for a given IP, ensuring a client always connects to the same server (unless there's a change in server status).
    - This method can help with cache hit rates in certain applications.

5. **Weighted Round Robin**:
    - Similar to round robin, but servers are assigned a weight.
    - More powerful servers get a higher weight and thus handle more requests.

6. **Weighted Least Connections**:
    - Similar to the least connections, but with weight added to the server.
    - Servers with a higher weight get more connections.

7. **Agent-Based Adaptive Load Balancing**:
    - Servers report their load to a central 'agent' server.
    - The agent determines where to send the next request based on server loads.

8. **Network Load Balancing (NLB)**:
    - Distributed algorithm which allows a set of machines to equally share incoming traffic.
    - Each machine makes an independent decision whether to forward or discard a packet, and the overall behavior ensures a roughly equal distribution.

9. **Central Load Balancing**:
    - A single device (often specialized) makes decisions about which server handles the incoming request. This device has the global knowledge about the state of each server.

10. **CPU Load Balancing**:
    - The current CPU and memory usage of all servers are monitored, and incoming requests are distributed based on which server has the lowest CPU and memory utilization.

11. **Session Persistence/Sticky Session**:
    - Ensures that a user's session is always directed to the same server they initially connected to. This is important for web applications where data is stored temporarily on one server for a user's session.

Each of these algorithms has its own advantages and is suitable for specific scenarios. The choice of algorithm often depends on the nature of the application, the variation in server performance, and other specific requirements.
